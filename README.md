# epidermal_data
Scripts to load and modify segmented epidermal immunofluorescence data


This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts which allow 
immunofluorescence data from human epidermis to be loaded and/or
modified.


The data for processing with these scripts are hosted at [GigaDB](http://gigadb.address/for/data "GigaDB")


A detailed description of these data are given within a corresponding GigaScience Data Note:
	* Cursons, J. et al. (2015). Spatially-transformed fluorescence image data for ERK-MAPK and selected proteins within human epidermis. GigaScience. Submitted Sept 2015.
	* doi: to-be-designated


Some of the concepts for this project (such as the normalised distance coordinate) are detailed within another publication:
	* Cursons, J. et al. (2015). Regulation of ERK-MAPK signaling in human epidermis. BMC Systems Biology. 
	* doi: 10.1186/s12918-015-0187-6
