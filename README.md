# epidermal_data
Scripts to load and modify segmented epidermal immunofluorescence data


This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts which allow 
immunofluorescence data from human epidermis to be loaded and/or
modified.


The data for processing with these scripts are hosted at [GigaDB](http://gigadb.address/for/data "GigaDB"):
	* Cursons, J; Angel, C, E; Hurley, D, G; Print, C, G; Dunbar, P; Jacobs, M, D; Crampin, E, J. (2015). [Supporting data for "Spatially-transformed fluorescence image data for ERK-MAPK and selected proteins within human epidermis"](http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100168). GigaScience Database. 


A detailed description of these data are given within a corresponding GigaScience Data Note:
	* Cursons, J. et al. (2015). [Spatially-transformed fluorescence image data for ERK-MAPK and selected proteins within human epidermis](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13742-015-0102-5). GigaScience. Accepted Nov 2015.


Some of the concepts for this project (such as the normalised distance coordinate) are detailed within another publication:
	* Cursons, J. et al. (2015). [Regulation of ERK-MAPK signaling in human epidermis](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12918-015-0187-6). BMC Systems Biology. *9*(1): 41
